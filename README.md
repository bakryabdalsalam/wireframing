# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a skeletal framework for a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and functionality, focusing on layout, navigation, and content placement. Wireframes help designers and developers visualize the design and user interactions before moving to detailed visuals or development.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

- **Clarity in Design:** Helps translate abstract ideas into a tangible format.
- **Early Problem Identification:** Identifies usability issues before heavy development begins.
- **Efficient Collaboration:** Aligns stakeholders, designers, and developers with a shared vision of the product.
